# Musically

## Introduction

Welcome to the Music Store project, a web application designed to provide users with a seamless experience in browsing musical instruments and accessories. Built using Laravel, this project showcases the power of modern web development frameworks in creating dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Features and Database Schema

The Music Store project offers a range of features designed to enhance user experience and streamline administrative tasks. Users can browse a variety of instruments and accessories, view detailed product information, and read customer testimonials. The admin dashboard allows for the management of products, including the ability to add, edit, delete, and restore items.

### Features

- **User Interface**: A clean and responsive design with sections for featured instruments, customer testimonials, and the latest news.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage instruments and accessories, view trashed items, and restore them if needed.
- **Soft Deletes**: Implemented using Laravel's soft delete functionality, allowing items to be moved to trash and restored later.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality for administrators.

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to efficiently store and manage data related to instruments, accessories, and user interactions. Key tables include:

- **Instruments**: Stores information about each instrument, including name, type, price, and soft delete status.
- **Accessories**: Similar to instruments, this table holds details about each accessory.
- **Users**: Manages user credentials and permissions for accessing the admin dashboard.

## Thoughts on Laravel - Bhavya

- It was a great learning experience for me. I surely learned something really new for me. I had never worked with PHP or Laravel before so it was overwhelming. There are many files we need to take care of, which is sometimes confusing. It's like I feel I don't know which file I'm working on. But surely if I'll do more practice then I'll get comfortable with it. Thank you for the great lectures, they were definitely helpful. I am looking forward to practising more and expanding my knowledge of Laravel.
